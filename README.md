## Safe Haven

SafeHaven is a Raspberri Pi based security system that combines sensors 
(motion and ultrasonic) with a Flask web application for real time monitoring.
It detects motion and triggers alarms, storing relevant user data like the history of
detections.  At the same time, the system sends an alert to the user's phone number,
to make sure the users are secure at all times. Designed for home/office security,
SafeHaven prioritizes accessibility with its simple GUI and low-cost hardware.

Safe Haven is being developed by making use of Software such as:
- Python
- Flask
- CustomTkinter * Tkinter
- HTML
- JavaScript
- RPi.GPIO
- GPIOZERO
- SMTPLIB & SSL
- JSON
- PIL

At the same, we are using different hardware, which includes:

- Raspberry Pi 400
- Buzzer
- UltraSonic sensor
- Motion sensor
- LEDs
- Recycled case
